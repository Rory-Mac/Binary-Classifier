# Binary-Classifier
This repository contains an object-oriented-programming package that performs binary classification on any n-dimensional linearly-separable dataset (provided that 
the dataset has been preprocessed by the client application into binary form). It can be used for demonstration in introductory neural network and machine learning courses in tertiary education, or as a visual study tool for any individual who wishes to better understand the workings of binary classification.
